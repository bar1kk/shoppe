# Shoppe - E-Commerce Jewelry Store Front-End

This project is the front-end for "Shoppe," an e-commerce application for a jewelry store, originally developed as a university term paper. It showcases a complete and feature-rich user-facing experience, from Browse and filtering products to a full checkout and user account management system.

The application is built with React and communicates with a pre-existing Java Spring Boot REST API for data and authentication.

## üìù Backend Information

This frontend was developed to work with a Java Spring Boot backend. The backend provides the REST API for products, users, authentication, and orders, which this application consumes. You can find the original repository containing both frontend and backend [here](https://github.com/Danilbel/shoppe).
